# Highlights

- Hybrid Digital Twin couples OpenSeesPy NLTHA with Physics-Guided Neural Network
- FEM restoring forces inform per-story inverse-variance weights during training
- R²=0.783 (N=3) and R²=0.713 (N=10) on complete PEER NGA-West2 database
- Whiplash effect: monotonic accuracy drop from base (0.754) to roof (0.601)
- CPU inference at 2 ms enables real-time structural health monitoring
