# Source Code Directory

This directory contains the Python source code for the Hybrid Digital Twin framework.

## Structure

This directory will contain modules for:

- **OpenSeesPy Integration**: Non-linear time history analysis implementation for RC buildings
- **PINN Models**: Physics-Informed Neural Network models for structural damage prediction
- **Data Processing**: Utilities for processing structural response data
- **Real-time Prediction**: Components for real-time inter-story drift prediction
- **Digital Twin Core**: Core digital twin orchestration and synchronization logic

## Getting Started

Implement your Python modules here following a modular structure, for example:
- `opensees_analysis/` - OpenSeesPy analysis scripts
- `pinn/` - Physics-Informed Neural Network implementations
- `preprocessing/` - Data preprocessing utilities
- `utils/` - Common utility functions
