"""
Hybrid Digital Twin Framework for Seismic RC Buildings

A Python-based framework for real-time structural damage prediction using:
- OpenSeesPy for non-linear time history analysis
- Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for damage prediction
- Real-time inter-story drift monitoring

This package provides tools for building and deploying digital twins of
RC structures for seismic resilience assessment.
