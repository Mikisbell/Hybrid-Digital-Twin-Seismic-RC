# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploration, analysis, and demonstration of the Hybrid Digital Twin framework.

## Structure

Suggested notebook categories:

### 1. Exploratory Analysis
- `01_data_exploration.ipynb` - Explore OpenSeesPy simulation results
- `02_structural_response_visualization.ipynb` - Visualize inter-story drifts and damage patterns

### 2. Model Development
- `03_pinn_architecture_development.ipynb` - Design and test PINN architectures
- `04_physics_constraints_implementation.ipynb` - Implement physics-based loss functions
- `05_hyperparameter_tuning.ipynb` - Optimize model hyperparameters

### 3. Analysis & Validation
- `06_model_training.ipynb` - Train PINN models on simulation data
- `07_model_validation.ipynb` - Validate predictions against test data
- `08_sensitivity_analysis.ipynb` - Analyze model sensitivity to input parameters

### 4. Applications
- `09_real_time_prediction_demo.ipynb` - Demonstrate real-time damage prediction
- `10_digital_twin_visualization.ipynb` - Visualize digital twin behavior

## Best Practices

- Use clear, descriptive names with numbering for execution order
- Include markdown cells explaining the purpose and methodology
- Save outputs for reference but clear large outputs before committing
- Keep notebooks focused on a single topic or task
